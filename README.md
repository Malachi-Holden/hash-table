To compile type

$make

into the terminal
There should be no errors. Contact me if there are any compile errors

then type

$./main

to run the test code. Feel free to write your own test code in the main

to initialize a hashSet object use the format

hashSet<K> myhashset = hashSet<K>();

then to add a new item into the hashSet write

myhashset.add(key);

to check if an item is in the set, write

myhashset.hasKey(key);

to remove an item from the set, write

myhashtable.remove(key);

to see how many items are in the set, use

myhashtable.size();

to print everything in the hashSet, use

std::cout<<myhashset<<std::endl;

To see an example of a set containing people's names, see the main.cpp code
